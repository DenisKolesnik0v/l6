Blueberry Girl


		Ladies of Light & Ladies Of Darkness,
		& Ladies of Never-You-Mind,
		This is a prayer for a Blueberry Girl.
		First, may you Ladies be kind.

		Keep her from spindles and sleeps at sixteen;
		Let her stay waking and wise.
		Nightmares at three; or bad husbands at thirty;
		These will not trouble her eyes.

		Dull days at forty, false friends at fifteen;
		Let her have brave days and truth.
		Let her go places that we’ve never been;
		Trust and delight in her youth.

		Ladies of Grace, and Ladies of Favour,
		And Ladies of Merciful Night,
		This is a prayer for a Blueberry Girl,
		Grant her your Clearness of Sight.

		Words can be worrisome, people complex;
		Motives and manners unclear.
		Grant her the wisdom to choose her path right,
		Free from unkindness and fear.

		Let her tell stories, and dance in the rain,
		Somersaults, tumble and run;
		Her joys must be high as her sorrows are deep,
		Let her grow like a weed in the sun.

		Ladies of Paradox, Ladies of Measure,
		Ladies of Shadows-That-Fall;
		this is a prayer for a Blueberry Girl,
		Words written clear on a Wall.

		Help her to help herself, help her to stand,
		Help her to lose, and to find.
		Teach her we’re only as big as our dreams,
		show her that fortune is blind.

		Truth is a thing she must find for herself,
		precious, and rare as a pearl;
		Give her all these, and a little bit more,
		Gifts for a Blueberry Girl.
